# Dictionary

A dictionary application I created using Java and Android Studio.

The application is equipped with a "Define" button. Once the user enters the word and clicks "Define", the definition of the word is presented below along with the word defined. Simultaneously,the text area is cleared after each definition to allow the user to re-enter words without having to delete each word entered.

In this video, various words are entered and their definitions are presented. When a word is not found in the dictionary, a "No Definition found" text is presented.
